# debugproject 


# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to look over and debug some code. I have uploaded the changes made to the code so that it is actually functional and working!

#What did you do particularly well?
I think that I was able to effectively make sure that the code not only functioned but followed common code practice and guidelines for furture developers to make changes to.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think if I could enhance this code in any way, I would add some deeper logic to make the steps make even more sense and allow for future edits. This would enable furture improvements to make the application faster and more effective at its goal.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found most of the project decently moderate to work with. I was able to pick through and find some of the errors that were present and make the required changes.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
One of the skills I gained was the ability to better review my code, work on inline comments that make sense and are readeable to others. This will help me with future code endevours.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure to make inline and readable code throughout the project where needed!
